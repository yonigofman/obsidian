Creating a Docker container for a Maven-based Spring Boot application involves several steps. You need to ensure your Spring Boot application is ready for Docker, create a Dockerfile to define the container image, and then build and run the Docker container. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Prerequisites

- Java and Maven installed
- Docker installed
- A Spring Boot project

### Steps

1. **Prepare Your Spring Boot Application**

   Ensure your Spring Boot application is working correctly. You should be able to build and run it using Maven commands:

   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

2. **Create a Dockerfile**

   In the root directory of your Spring Boot project, create a file named `Dockerfile`. This file will contain the instructions to build the Docker image.

   ```dockerfile
   # Use an official JDK runtime as a parent image
   FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine

   # Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the executable JAR file from the target directory to the container
   COPY target/your-app-name-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

   # Expose the port that the application runs on
   EXPOSE 8080

   # Run the JAR file
   ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
   ```

   Replace `your-app-name-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` with the actual name of the JAR file generated by Maven.

3. **Build the Docker Image**

   Use the `docker build` command to create a Docker image from your Dockerfile.

   ```bash
   docker build -t your-app-name .
   ```

   This command builds the Docker image and tags it with `your-app-name`.

4. **Run the Docker Container**

   Use the `docker run` command to start a container from your image.

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 your-app-name
   ```

   This command maps port 8080 of the container to port 8080 on your host machine, so you can access the application via `http://localhost:8080`.

### Full Example

Here’s a complete example with all the steps combined:

1. **Spring Boot Project Structure**

   Your project structure should look something like this:

   ```
   my-spring-boot-app/
   ├── src/
   │   └── main/
   │       └── java/
   │           └── com/
   │               └── example/
   │                   └── demo/
   │                       └── DemoApplication.java
   ├── pom.xml
   └── Dockerfile
   ```

2. **Dockerfile**

   ```dockerfile
   # Use an official JDK runtime as a parent image
   FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine

   # Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the executable JAR file from the target directory to the container
   COPY target/my-spring-boot-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

   # Expose the port that the application runs on
   EXPOSE 8080

   # Run the JAR file
   ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
   ```

3. **Build the Project**

   Run the Maven build command to package your application:

   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

4. **Build the Docker Image**

   Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-spring-boot-app .
   ```

5. **Run the Docker Container**

   Start a container from the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 my-spring-boot-app
   ```

### Additional Tips

- **Docker Compose:** For more complex setups, consider using Docker Compose to define and run multi-container Docker applications. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define services, networks, and volumes.

- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to pass configuration options to your Spring Boot application. You can define these in the Dockerfile or `docker-compose.yml`.

- **Optimizing the Dockerfile:** For production use, consider optimizing your Dockerfile by using multi-stage builds to minimize the final image size.

By following these steps, you can containerize your Maven-based Spring Boot application and run it using Docker, making it easy to deploy and manage in different environments.
